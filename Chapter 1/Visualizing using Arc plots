Following on what you've learned about the nxviz API, now try making an ArcPlot of the network.
Two keyword arguments that you will try here are node_order='keyX' and node_color='keyX', 
in which you specify a key in the node metadata dictionary to color and order the nodes by.

matplotlib.pyplot has been imported for you as plt.

Instructions:
-------------
Import ArcPlot from nxviz.
Create an un-customized ArcPlot of T. To do this, use the ArcPlot() function with just T as the argument.
Create another ArcPlot of T in which the nodes are ordered and colored by the 'category' keyword.
You'll have to specify the node_order and node_color parameters to do this. For both plots,
be sure to draw them to the screen and display them with plt.show().

script.py:
----------
# Import necessary modules
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from nxviz import ArcPlot

# Create the un-customized ArcPlot object: a
a = ArcPlot(T)

# Draw a to the screen
a.draw()

# Display the plot
plt.show()

# Create the customized ArcPlot object: a2
a2 = ArcPlot(T,node_order='category',node_color='category')

# Draw a2 to the screen
a2.draw()

# Display the plot
plt.show()


Extra Comments:
-----------------
Notice the node coloring in the customized ArcPlot compared to the uncustomized version.
In the customized ArcPlot, the nodes in each of the categories - 'I', 'D', and 'P' - have their own color.
If it's difficult to see on your screen, 
you can expand the plot into a new window by clicking on the pop-out icon on the top-left next to 'Plots'.
